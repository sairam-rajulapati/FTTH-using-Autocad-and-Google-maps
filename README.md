# 1. Introduction
An FTTH network for a residential area using Google Maps and AutoCAD,scaled the map using a known distance, traced roads, placed the OLT near a central location, routed feeder fiber along the main road, identified service and non-service areas, and planned splitters near residential clusters for efficient distribution.

# 2. Methodology
Using GIS (Google Maps) for base data

Performing accurate map scaling

Planning OLT, feeder, distribution routes
Google Maps satellite image of Cherukumilli Ramalayam area

Known reference distance: 500.65 meters

AutoCAD for planning & design

Identifying service & non-service zones

Ensuring practical field deployment feasibility
